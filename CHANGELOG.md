- RENAMED: See flutter_map_supercluster package

## [0.0.2]

- Increase cluster/point search bounds to accomodate the cluster width/height so
  that the clusters are visible as soon as any part of the cluster is visible
  instead of when half or more of the cluster is within the bounds.
- Remove comptueSize option as it made the above change impossible.

## [0.0.1]

- First release
